# teaCozyProject
Codecademy Off-Platform Project

In this project, you will create a fictional tea shop website on your own computer.

We will provide a design spec and image assets to help you along the way. A design spec is an image of a web page outlined with all of its CSS properties and values. 
These are usually created by a designer as a source of instructions for a web developer. This project assumes that you will be able to reproduce the basic HTML and CSS with little guidance.

### Additions added to project (Date 5/23/23)

In order to get a better understanding of how to use react I decided to take this project and create a react version. By following a different tutorial I was able to create an indexReact.html file and duplicate the layout of the original project. Within this version of the project, I gained a better understanding:

*JSX syntax
*Rendering elements using React Fragments
*Create simple reusable React Components
*Styling React Components
